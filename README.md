*I've changed a few "Invalid Maps" from the tester accordingly to what I interpreted from the .pdf as correct or wrong.*



**** Info ****

To run my project on Mac simply type "Make" or "Make re" to compile and run one of each map that isn't _bonus.cub \
To run my project on Linux simply type "Make linux" to compile and run one of each map that isn't _bonus.cub \
`./cub3D ./maps/test.cub` \
`./cub3D ./maps/test2.cub` 

To run the Bonus project, on Mac type "Make bonus", on Linux type "Make linux_bonus" and run the map that ends with _bonus.cub \
`./cub3D ./maps/test_bonus.cub` 

These links helped me with the project.
